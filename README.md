#  Valorant Performance Staker

This is a fun little project built on Solana using the Anchor framework. The idea is simple:
I have some friends that enjoy playing the famous FPS game "Valorant", but tend to get into arguments about who performed the worst. So i thought why not create a Solana program that settles this once and for all?

##  Purpose

The main goal of this project is to deepen my understanding of:
- Integrating off chain APIs with on-chain logic in a hybrid setup
- Structuring a full stack Solana project (Rust program + client + API layer)

---

##  How this will work (Work In Progress)

- Once a game concludes, riot API is triggered to pull the latest match stats for the group
- Metrics are checked to see worst performer
- Use Solana program on-chain to penalize worst performer
- Maybe split penalty among other players?

## Some thoughts
I've enjoyed exploring Solana programs at a much deeper level. One issue that will arise with my idea is that a Solana program cannot directly interact with the RIOT API due to limitations (and with good reason). Because of this, it looks like Iâ€™ll need to create a custom oracle that fetches the data and calls the necessary instructions on the smart contract.
For a project of this scale, this isn't a problem as this is a fun project between friends. However, building my own oracle would raise concerns about safety, since the whole point of blockchain is decentralization. I'm aware of decentralized oracle providers such as Chainlink that aim to solve this issue, and I find this very interesting!
